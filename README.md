**Overview of Election Audit:** 

The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

    The voter turnout for each county
    The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
    The county with the highest turnout

**Purpose of this project:**

Working from this moduleâ€™s election_results.csv file, to print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file.

Finally, provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.
